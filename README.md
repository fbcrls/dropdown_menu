# dropdown_menu

A dropdown in Flutter is a Material Design widget that allows users to select one item from a list of items. Dropdown widgets are typically used to select a value from a list of options, such as the user's country or the size of a product.

To create a dropdown in Flutter, you can use the DropdownButton widget. The DropdownButton widget takes a number of properties, including:

- items: A list of DropdownMenuItem objects that represent the items in the dropdown list.
- value: The current value of the dropdown.
- onChanged: A callback function that is called when the value of the dropdown changes.
- hint: The text that is displayed when the dropdown is not open.
